The pizza website i have created using PHP and the Materialize CSS framework allows users to access information about different pizzas. The website is connected to a database, which stores data such as pizza ingredients, creation dates, and the creators of each pizza.

Users can browse through the pizzas listed on the website and view detailed information about each one. This includes the list of ingredients used in each pizza, the date it was created, and the name of the person who created it.

By leveraging PHP and Materialize CSS, i  have created an interactive and visually appealing platform that provides users with easy access to information about various pizzas.
